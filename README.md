This is my Codepath project for the WEB 101 course. It is a cartoon-ish event website that is responsive for desktop and mobile devices, with the inclusion of a navbar 
that shrinks to a hamburger menu when screen size decrease.

CSS grid and flexbox to ensure responsiveness.

It uses JavaScript for form validation to ensure the user submit valid information.

JavaScript is also used to enable a dynamic light mode/dark mode button that changes layout based on user preference.
