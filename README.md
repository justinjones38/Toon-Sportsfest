This is my Codepath project for the WEB 101 course. It is a cartoon-ish event website that is responsive for desktop and mobile devices, with the inclusion of a navbar 
that shrinks to a hamburger menu when screen size decrease.

CSS grid and flexbox to ensure responsiveness.

It uses JavaScript for form validation to ensure the user submit valid information.
